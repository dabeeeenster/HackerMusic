* Put in station information
* Abstract out config settings - default users, db name, icecast info, etc
* Display currently playing song in layout
* Move 'upcoming' to layout
* Add voted_at field, secondary sorting based on timestamp to queue
* Reorganize song list into partial, put browsing stuff into layout
* Add browsing by track, artist, album, genre, etc
* Add admin section for create / delete users, reset passwords
* Possibility for multiple votes
* Vote archiving
* Better design
* README / setup instructions
* Use filename / dir names when taglib returns nothing
* make admin section more REST-y
* Run on Thin / MySQL for better handling
* Add individual artist / album pages beneath artist/:letter
* give search page its own URL, screw AJAX (stop breaking the back button / redirects)
* remove primitive shell scripts, update README to reflect default thin settings
* make static site hackermusic.com to advertise the project (use webby?)
* Make upload / downloads / previews configurable

IDEAS:
- Logic to prevent multiple plays / day
- Skip current song option (only for user who requested current song? only for admin?)
- itunes library importer option
- default playlist file instead of random selections
* flash player to preview songs before voting
* upload form / flash obj (for multiple, large uplaods) so people can drop in their own music
- better security on uploading? random user ids? upload key?
* link to download songs / currently playing song
- reports: most-played genres, participation ratios, etc
- package into a gem?
- mpd support
